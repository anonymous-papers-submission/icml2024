# Identifying Latent State Transition Processes for Individualized Reinforcement Learning
## Overview
In this paper, we present a practical method that effectively learns the individualized state-transition processes from observed state-action trajectories, backed by theoretical guarantees. 
## Requirements
To install it, create a conda environment with Python>=3.6 and follow the instructions below. Note that the current implementation of Individualized-VAE requires a GPU.
```ruby
conda create -n ivae python=3.6.13
cd ivae
pip install -e .
```
